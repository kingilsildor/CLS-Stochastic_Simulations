# Objectives
1. To understand the foundations of probability theory and how it is applicable to various stochastic processes
2. To be able to construct and evaluate stochastic models to simulate various real-world systems from finance to biomedicine
3. To be able to perform an efficient simulation based on this model to capture the dynamics of key performance measures
4. To be able to analyze and test the validity of such models
5. To be able to interpret correctly the predictions of these stochastic models

# Contents
The course builds on the mathematical foundations of probability theory while putting the emphasis on the tools used most often in computer simulations. Our main tool of study are the simulations themselves, therefore the study procedure includes a significant amount of programming. In particular we focus on the following topics:
- Elements of probability theor
- Random numbers
- Statistical analysis of data and error estimation
- Hypothesis testing and validation of simulation data
- Variance reduction techniques
- Discrete event simulations
- Queuing theory
- Random walks and Wiener process
- Monte Carlo and Metropolis methods
- Importance sampling
- Simulated annealing

# Recommended prior knowledge
Basic programming knowledge is necessary. The course preference is Python, but other languages are possible in agreement with the lecturer.
Basic knowledge on the following (while not required) is highly useful: probability theory, stochastic modelling, Markov chains.

# Teaching method and contact hours
- Lecture
- Computer lab session/practical training
- Working independently on e.g. a project or thesis

# Study materials
## Literature:
The primary book for the course: Sheldon M. Ross, Simulation, 5th edition. Additional material is provided in form of scientific papers and detailed slides.
## Syllabus:
There is a summary slide deck that is presented during the first lecture containing the details and requirements.

# Assessment
Completing 3 coding assignments in teams of two, and producing a detailed report on all three.  Written exam focusing on the theory at the end of the course.
